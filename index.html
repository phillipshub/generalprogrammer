        <!-- About Me -->
        <p>
            I am a general programmer located in San Diego, California. I am passionate
            about programming and capable of doing so on a variety of platforms. I hold more than half a dozen
            certifications in various programming languages and an associate’s degree specializing in computer
            programming from SDCC. The bulk of my knowledge is in compiled programming although I am also quite familiar
            with WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere) programming and script languages as well. My favorite programming
            languages to work in are C++ and Python. Beyond holding multiple certifications in several different
            programming languages, I am also an open source software developer with a couple of publicly available
            software releases via GitHub.

            <b>I can be fun to work with! </b>Fact: The first computer bug was an actual moth! In 1947, engineers
            working on the Harvard Mark II
            computer found a moth trapped in a relay, causing a malfunction. They typed it into their logbook with the
            note: “First actual case of bug being found.” That’s how the term “debugging” got its wings—literally!

            <b>UML Diagram Maker: </b>UML diagrams are important to programmers because they provide a clear, visual
            representation of a system’s structure and behavior, making it easier to design, communicate, and
            maintain
            complex software. They help identify relationships between components, clarify requirements, and support
            collaboration across teams during development. UML Diagram Maker transforms the daunting task of
            creating
            UML diagrams into a simple data entry process. The program gathers input and outputs a properly
            formatted
            UML diagram that can easily be placed directly inside the programmer's documentation.

            <b>Simple Benchmark Test: </b>Monitoring server performance over time is essential for maintaining
            system
            reliability, optimizing resource usage, and ensuring a seamless user experience. By collecting and
            analyzing
            metrics such as server load. Simple Benchmark Test (SBT) is a light weight tool that runs a simple task
            on a
            schedule keeping records of the date and time required to run the program.

            <b>Prime Race: </b>Famous retired Microsoft Engineer David Plumber held a competition between
            programming
            languages to solve the age old dispute as to what programming language is the fastest. My submission is
            in
            C++ a compiled programming language. The given task was to see how many times your program could
            correctly
            find all prime numbers in a given range within a certain time span. I did not win the competition but
            did
            however receive encouraging feedback complementing how clean my code is.
